# 🐘 Legacy Data Conversion Project (Postgres + Python)

This project simulates a **real-world data conversion**: migrating data from a messy **legacy database** into a clean **destination schema** using both **SQL (dblink)** and **Python ETL**.

It mirrors the work of a Conversion Engineer — extracting data from legacy systems, transforming it with business rules, and loading it into a modern schema.
